<a id="LinkingYourRecord"><h3>Linking Your Record</h3></a>
Applicants for a library card are given the option to &quot;link&quot; their record to another patron on our application form. This service allows increased ease of navigation between cardholders belonging to the same family. Note that linking patron records is solely intended to expedite circulation transactions by allowing for quick navigation between one linked record and the next.<br>
Linking records does not give a patron the ability to view, request or borrow items on a card belonging to a patron to whom they are linked.<br>
In situations where one patron (e.g. a spouse) would like to be authorized to collect requested items held by another, both patrons must first confirm this in person with a Library staff member.  A note will then be placed on the records of both patrons. This applies only to active hold requests, not additional checkouts on the card.<br>
<a id="LostandReplacementLibraryCards"><h3>Lost and Replacement Library Cards</h3></a>
When you register for a Fiction Land Public Library card, you accept responsibility for all items on the card, all use made of the card and all charges made against it until your card is reported lost.  The Library must have a record of your card having been reported lost, or it is not considered lost.  Therefore it is to the patron’s benefit to report the loss or theft of a library card immediately.<br>
The cost of replacing a lost or stolen library card is $1.00.    This fee is assessed at the time the card is reported lost.<br>
Report lost cards by phone, in person at any Library location, or by email.  Eligible users may also apply for a replacement library card online.<br>
<a id="LibraryNotices"><h3>Library Notices</h3></a>
The Fiction Land Public Library provides a notification service for held items, overdue materials &amp; other service-specific reasons.  Notices are available via telephone or e-mail &amp; the method by which you receive them is chosen at the time you apply for a card.  Additionally, notices and bills for overdue material will be sent to the mailing address on record at the Library.  It is the responsibility of the borrower to notify The Library if any of their contact information changes.<br>
Note: In the case of borrowers who receive their notices by e-mail, it is their responsibility to make sure that e-mails sent from addresses with @fiction-land-library.org in the sender information be allowed through any filters they may have in place on their Inbox.<br>
Failure to receive a notice does not absolve the borrower from any fines or fees attached to their patron record.
